# Discord-2.0

This is just a test project to learn about MongoDB's API and decided to implement it in a chat app similar to discord which also uses a database to store messages.
Thus I don't need to write much of server (database) side code and a very little of client side code.

This is a very bad replica of discord as there are still some bugs which need to be fixed but I won't since this was just a test project related to MongoDB.
There are some advantages and disadvantages of using this approach-
| Advantages                            | Disadvantages                     |
| -----------                           | -----------                       |
| Lesser server & client side code      |       Slow                        |
| Fairly secure                         | Need to maintain a large Database |

There are probably more points to this but I'm lazy to list them all.


### Installation
Execute this code in your terminal-
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Setting up MongoDB
You can register / login to your account for MongoDB [here](https://account.mongodb.com/account/login). After setting up your account and creating a database in your cluster, paste your token in the `.env.token` file.


Finally, execute `main.py`.
